## Anonymization
You can manually anonymize `Attachment` using management command:

```
manage.py attachment_anonymization attachment [options] [file]

Options:
  -v VERBOSITY, --verbosity=VERBOSITY
                        Verbosity level; 0=minimal output, 1=normal output,
                        2=verbose output, 3=very verbose output
  --settings=SETTINGS   The Python path to a settings module, e.g.
                        "myproject.settings.main". If this isn't provided, the
                        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable will be
                        used.
  --pythonpath=PYTHONPATH
                        A directory to add to the Python path, e.g.
                        "/home/djangoprojects/myproject".
  --traceback           Raise on exception
  --no-color            Don't colorize the command output.
  -f FILENAME, --file=FILENAME
                        define file path
  --content_type=CONTENT_TYPE
                        define content type of file
  --debug=DEBUG         add debug message
  --force               overwrite an existing successful
                        AttachmentFinalization
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```
